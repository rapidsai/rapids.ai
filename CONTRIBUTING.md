## Development Environment

Use the included devcontainer for local development.

Start the container and run `hugo serve` to start a development server.

To view draft files, run `hugo serve -D`.

The development server can be viewed in a browser at <http://localhost:1313>.

## Project Layout

This repository uses the [standard Hugo directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/).

Here are some general guidelines to follow:

- Site content should go in [content](./content/)
- HTML layouts (e.g. for landing pages) should go in [layouts](./layouts/)
- Section content (e.g. partners, announcements, docs, etc.) should include an archetype template in [archetypes](./archetypes/) (see section on archetypes below)
- Global assets (e.g. CSS, JavaScript, images used in more than one location, etc.) should go in [assets](./assets/)
  - Page-specific assets should be alongside the page itself in the [content](./content/) directory

## Using Archetypes to Generate New Content

Hugo [archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/) provide a template for creating new content.

Once an archetype template is created, it can be used like this:

```sh
# Create a new partner
hugo new _partners/dask-sql

# Create a new announcement
hugo new announcements/cuda-12-deprecation
```
