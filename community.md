<section class="about-rapids contact-rapids">
    <div class="fixed-content">
        <div class="sub-heading">RAPIDS is for everyone—users, adopters, and contributors. If you’re a data
            scientist, researcher, engineer, or developer using pandas, Dask, scikit-learn, or Spark on CPUs
            and looking for 50X end-to-end pipeline speedups at scale, look no further. Download RAPIDS and
            give us a run. The RAPIDS cuDF library is almost a drop-in, API-compatible, GPU-accelerated
            replacement for pandas and Dask (if you want to scale to multi-GPU and multi-node).<br>
            <br>
            RAPIDS is also open sourced under the Apache 2.0 open-source license and is intended to be built
            upon and hardened in the community. While significant time and effort have been invested into
            making the platform usable and relevant, we need active contributors to help improve it and
            build its future.

            <h2>Become a RAPIDS Adopter</h2>
            <p>RAPIDS features a highly GPU-optimized core dataframe and machine learning kernels that are perfect for adopters who are building high-performance databases, stream processing, machine learning applications, and more. RAPIDS handles the low-level GPU-accelerated NVIDIA® CUDA® code, so you can focus on integrating it with your solution. RAPIDS Python binding can be integrated into the solution as well. Adopters should announce their plans on our public channels. If approved, we’ll add a link to the project on the RAPIDS website.</p>
