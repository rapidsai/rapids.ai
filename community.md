# RAPIDS Community
{: .section-title-halfs}

RAPIDS is for everyone: users, adopters, and contributors. If youâ€™re a data scientist, researcher, engineer, or developer using pandas, Dask, scikit-learn, or Spark on CPUs, our **[RAPIDS projects](https://github.com/rapidsai){: target="_blank"}** are almost drop in replacements that can speed up your end-to-end workflow up to 50x.

## <i class="fas fa-code"></i> Open Source
{: .section-subtitle-top-1}
RAPIDS is open sourced under the Apache 2.0 license and is intended to be improved and extended upon by help from the community. While significant time and effort have been invested into making the platform to date, we need active contributors to help build its future.
