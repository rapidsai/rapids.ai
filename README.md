This repository contains the source code and content for the [RAPIDS.ai](https://rapids.ai) website.

The site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator with the [Docsy theme](https://github.com/google/docsy).

## Requirements

All logos and images are located in the [images](/static/images) folder. Externally (no website) referenced files should be placed in the [assets](/assets) folder.

Font Icons are used from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), and include Pro account icons.

## Pull Request Previews

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) will create a preview environment when PRs are opened.

## Contributing

You can use the included devcontainer for local development.

Start the container and run `hugo serve` to start a development server.

To view draft files, run `hugo serve -D`.

The development server can be viewed in a browser at <http://localhost:1313>.
