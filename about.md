# About RAPIDS 
{: .section-title-halfs}

The RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries and APIs gives you the ability to execute end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. Licensed under Apache 2.0, RAPIDS is incubated by **[NVIDIA®](https://developer.nvidia.com/open-source){: target="_blank"}** based on extensive hardware and data science science experience. RAPIDS utilizes **[NVIDIA CUDA®](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit){: target="_blank"}** primitives for low-level compute optimization, and exposes GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly Python interfaces.

RAPIDS also focuses on common data preparation tasks for analytics and data science. This includes a familiar dataframe API that integrates with a variety of machine learning algorithms for end-to-end pipeline accelerations without paying typical serialization costs. RAPIDS also includes support for multi-node, multi-GPU deployments, enabling vastly accelerated processing and training on much larger dataset sizes.

## Apache Arrow
RAPIDS had its start from the **[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/){: target="_blank"}** and **[GoAi](http://gpuopenanalytics.com){: target="_blank"}** projects based on a columnar, in-memory data structure that delivers efficient and fast data interchange with flexibility to support complex data models.

## Libraries and APIs Overview
{: .section-subtitle-top-1}

Some RAPIDS projects include **[cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf){: target="_blank"}**, a pandas-like dataframe manipulation library; **[cuML](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml){: target="_blank"}**, a collection of machine learning libraries that will provide GPU versions of algorithms available in scikit-learn; **[cuGraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph){: target="_blank"}**, a network-X like API that seamlessly integrate into the RAPIDS data science platform. Development follows a 6 week release schedule, so new features and libraries are always on the way. 

## Integration With Deep Learning Libraries
RAPIDS provides native array_interface support. This means data stored in Apache Arrow can be seamlessly pushed to deep learning frameworks that accept array_interface such as **[PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch){: target="_blank"}** and **[Chainer](https://github.com/chainer){: target="_blank"}**, or work with **[DLPack](https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack){: target="_blank"}** and **[MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet){: target="_blank"}**. 


## Visualization
Our focus on Python allows RAPIDS to play well with most data science visualization libraries. For even greater performance, we are working towards deeper integration with these libraries since a native GPU in-memory data format provides high-performance, high-FPS data visualization capabilities, even with very large datasets.
