  text: This is the second chapter in our blog series on GPU-accelerated graph analysis
    using RAPIDS cuGraph. In the first chapter, we introduced the basics of graphs
    and analyzed them using a few of the many algorithms in cuGraph. That blog answered
    some practical questions...

  text: When analyzing data, sometimes the relationships between the data elements
    are important along with the scope of the question being asked. In those cases,
    it is better to represent the data as a graph and apply graph analytics. An example
