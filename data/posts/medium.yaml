  poster: Don Acosta
  text: When analyzing data, sometimes the relationships between the data elements
    are important along with the scope of the question being asked. In those cases,
    it is better to represent the data as a graph and apply graph analytics. An example
    coming out of the COVID...

  text: Introduction Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are one of the fastest-growing tools
    in machine learning. GNNs combine a rich array of feature data (similar to the
    input of a traditional neural network) with network structure (represented as
    a graph). Depending on the work...
