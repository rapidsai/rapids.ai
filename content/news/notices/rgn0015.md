## Overview

`cuDF` was hotfixed to version `21.06.01`.

## Rationale

`cuDF` was hotfixed to fix an offset error which could lead to data corruption when writing ORC files with multiple large string columns, [#8538](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/8538).

## Impact

All v21.06 users are encouraged to update `cuDF` libraries to `21.06.01` as soon as possible.
