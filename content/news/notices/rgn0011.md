## Overview

Both `cuDF` and `cuXfilter` were hotfixed to version `0.19.1`.

## Rationale

`cuDF` was hotfixed for two bugs: [#8023](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/8023) [#8031](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/8031).

`cuXfilter` was hotfixed to resolve a [dependency conflict](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuxfilter/pull/271).

## Impact

All v0.19 users are encouraged to update `cudf` & `cuxfilter` libraries to `0.19.1` as soon as possible.
