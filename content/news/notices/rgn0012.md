## Overview

`cuDF` was hotfixed to version `0.19.2`.

## Rationale

`cuDF` was hotfixed to fix a deadlock that could occur in decompression in cuIO, [#8073](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/8073).

## Impact

All v0.19 users are encouraged to update `cudf` libraries to `0.19.2` as soon as possible.
