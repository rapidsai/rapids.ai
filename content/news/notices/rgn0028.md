## Overview

RAPIDS v22.06 was hotfixed to pin the `cuda-python` package dependency to a maximum version of `11.7.0` for several RAPIDS libraries.

## Rationale

`cuda-python` version `11.7.1` was recently released, which switched its dependency on the [cudatoolkit](https://anaconda.org/nvidia/cudatoolkit) package to the [cuda-toolkit](https://anaconda.org/nvidia/cuda-toolkit) package. This dependency change had unintended consequences for several RAPIDS libraries, including blocking installation for some users.

## Impact

All users are recommended to use the latest `22.06.01` version of all RAPIDS libraries.
