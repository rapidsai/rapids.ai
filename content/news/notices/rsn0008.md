## Overview

All RAPIDS projects will require `gcc/g++ 9.0+` in order to take advantage of new C++ features, notably including moving to C++17.

This also aligns RAPIDS with the current conda-forge build stack.

## Status

All `conda` builds and `docker` images use `gcc/g++ 9.3` starting with `v0.20` (now `v21.06`).

## Impact

Users building from source should use `gcc/g++ 9.0` or higher to build RAPIDS.
