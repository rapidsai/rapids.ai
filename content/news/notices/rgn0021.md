## Overview

`cuDF` was hotfixed to version `v21.12.02`.

## Rationale

`cuDF` was hotfixed to `v21.12.02` in order to fix a performance regression as noted in [#9898](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/9898).

## Impact

All v21.12 users are encouraged to update the `cuDF` library to `v21.12.02` as soon as possible.
