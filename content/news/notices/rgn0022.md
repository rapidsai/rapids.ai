## Overview

RAPIDS `v22.02` requires Python `3.8+`; Google Colab is currently limited to
Python `3.7`. Google Colab will only support up to RAPIDS `v21.12` until
Colab support for Python `3.8+` is complete. Users may make use of [SageMaker 
Studio Labs as an alternative "Try it Now"](/notices/rgn0023) for Stable (`v22.02`), Nightly (`v22.04`), 
and Legacy (`v21.12`) RAPIDS trials.

**NOTE:** Refer to [RSN 14](/notices/rsn0014) for more information about EOL support
of Python `3.7`.

## Status

- **12-Feb-2022** - Warnings have been added to links to Colab on RAPIDS
website; links to SageMaker Studio Lab have been added.

## Impact

Google Colab support for RAPIDS is currently limited to RAPIDS version `v21.12`.
Users can use SageMaker Studio Lab for all Stable (`v22.02`), Nightly (`v22.04`), 
and Legacy (`v21.12`) RAPIDS versions.
