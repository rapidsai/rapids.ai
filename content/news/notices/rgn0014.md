## Overview

`cuML` was hotfixed to version `21.06.02`.

## Rationale

`cuML` was hotfixed (`21.06.01`) to fix a bug with batch sizes larger than 32 bits, [#3971](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/pull/3971).

`cuML` was hotfixed (`21.06.02`) to fix a bug with missing OpenMP support, [#3988](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/issues/3988).

## Impact

All v21.06 users are encouraged to update `cuML` libraries to `21.06.02` as soon as possible.
