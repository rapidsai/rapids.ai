## Overview

`cuCIM` and `cuDF` were hotfixed to version `21.08.01`.

## Rationale

`cucim` was hotfixed to `21.08.01` in order to ensure the compiler stack aligned with the rest of RAPIDS, [#84](https://github.com/rapidsai/cucim/pull/84).

`cudf` was hotfixed to `21.08.01` in order to fix the bug, [#8984](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/8984) and performance degradation in concatenate for string columns, [#8968](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/8968).

## Impact

All v21.08 users are encouraged to update `cuCIM` and `cuDF` libraries to `21.08.01` as soon as possible.
