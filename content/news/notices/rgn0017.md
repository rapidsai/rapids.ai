## Overview

Four RAPIDS libraries were hotfixed to version `21.08.01` and cuDF was hotfixed to version `21.08.02`.

## Rationale

`rmm`, `cuml`, `cugraph`, and `cuspatial` were hotfixed to `21.08.01`. `cudf` was hotfixed to `21.08.02`. These five libraries were hotfixed in order to fix the conda package location of the CMake configuration files, [#56](https://github.com/rapidsai/rapids-cmake/issues/56).

## Impact

All v21.08 users are encouraged to update `rmm`, `cuml`, `cugraph`, and `cuspatial` libraries to `21.08.01` and `cuDF` to `21.08.02` as soon as possible.
