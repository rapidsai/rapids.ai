## Overview

All RAPIDS projects are switching their versioning scheme to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org).

This versioning will apply to both the overall RAPIDS release and each core library, so we will release `cuDF` `21.06.00`, `cuML` `21.06.00`, etc. as part of the overall RAPIDS `21.06.00` release.

## Impact

Instead of a `0.20.0` release in June 2021, we will release `21.06.00`

New version format for release: `YY.MM.PP`, for example `21.06.00`

New version format for nightlies: `YY.MM.PPaYYMMDD`, for example `21.06.00a210505`

Where `PP` is the two digit patch number not day.

ABI & API compatibility will be maintained within each `YY.MM.xx` release.
