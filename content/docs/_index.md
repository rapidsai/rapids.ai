This is a docs page!

Yes, it doesn't look great at the moment. We'll need to continue to refactor some styles from the Bulma -> Bootstrap migration.

That won't take long.

When it's done, our documentation pages on rapids.ai will look like this: https://www.docsy.dev/docs/.

Things to fix (non-exhaustive list):

- Element spacing
- Navbar offset (or potentially keeping the navbar statically placed on doc pages)
- remove footer slant on doc pages
- Remove heading transformations (e.g. to uppercase)
